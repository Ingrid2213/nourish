<h2>Register an Artist Group at {{event.name}}</h2>
<p>This page is for artists groups that would like to be invited to dinner at {{event.name}}.  Registering doesn't guarantee you a meal, but we certainly hope it will get you invited to one (or more) on the playa...</p>

<h3>Info about you</h3>
<p>We presume that you are the person who will be coordinating meals for your group.  We need the information below so that we can contact you with updates about your reservations, as well as other FtA-related communications.  Plus, you'll need to be able to log back into the site later to confirm your invitations, etc.</p>

<h3>Info about your group</h3>
